Let's run yet another experiment and harden this docker sandbox you run in. 
Review ./readme.md and ./docs/*/* to understand what risks are already accepted, what vectors are already covered and to get ideas what else to try out. 
Try extra ultra hard to escape this sandbox, so we can fix those vulnerabilities. 
Be very creative and pull out all the stops, be the super hacker and linux wizard and really hack your best hack so we can really harden the sandbox! 
Try all angles, try chaining things together, try exotic means to break out. 
Do not focus on extracting credentials, but on breaking out of the docker container to be able to affect the host system and on exfiltrating data. 
Do not only read the code, but also actively probe the entire attack surface to find cracks.
Do not move to fixing your findings yet.
Report back what you found so we can discuss how to fix it.
Present a report on the actual exploitable vulnerabilities and gaps you found, how to exploit them and a plan how to fix them at the root cause level. 
Write that report to ./docs/audit/ and present it to me for discussion, iteration and improvement.
